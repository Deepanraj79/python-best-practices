# Check if a variable equals a constant

# Bad:
```python
if attr == True:
    print('True!')

if attr == None:
    print('attr is None!')
```

# Good

```python
# Just check the value
if attr:
    print('attr is true!')

# or check for the opposite
if not attr:
    print('attr is false!')

# or, since None is considered false, explicitly check for it
if attr is None:
    print('attr is None!')
```

# Membership in Dict

```python
d = {'hello': 'world'}
if 'hello' in d:
    print(d['hello'])
```

# One statement per line

While some compound statements such as list comprehensions are allowed and appreciated for their brevity and their
expressiveness, it is bad practice to have two disjointed statements on the same line of code.

### Bad
```python
print('one'); print('two')

if x == 1: print('one')

if <complex comparison> and <other complex comparison>:
    # do something
```

### Good
```python
print('one')
print('two')

if x == 1:
    print('one')

cond1 = <complex comparison>
cond2 = <other complex comparison>
if cond1 and cond2:
    # do something
```

# Avoid multi-layer branch nesting
```python
def buy_fruit(nerd, store):
    """Go to the fruit store to buy apples.

    - First, check if the store is open.
    - If there are apples, buy 1
    - If the money is not enough, go home to take more money.
    """
    if store.is_open():
        if store.has_stocks("apple"):
            if nerd.can_afford(store.price("apple", amount=1)):
                nerd.buy(store, "apple", amount=1)
                return
            else:
                nerd.go_home_and_get_money()
                return buy_fruit(nerd, store)
        else:
            raise MadAtNoFruit("no apple in store!")
    else:
        raise MadAtNoFruit("store is closed!")
```
Such kind of code has poor readability and maintainability. However, we can use a very simple trick "End the function
in advance" to optimize the code:

```python
def buy_fruit(nerd, store):
    if not store.is_open():
        raise MadAtNoFruit("store is closed!")

    if not store.has_stocks("apple"):
        raise MadAtNoFruit("no apple in store!")

    if nerd.can_afford(store.price("apple", amount=1)):
        nerd.buy(store, "apple", amount=1)
        return
    else:
        nerd.go_home_and_get_money()
        return buy_fruit(nerd, store)
```

# Move the logical judgments to functions that are too complicated

```python
# If the activity is still active and the remaining quota of the activity is greater than 10, then
# 10,000 coins will be issued for all the active users whose genders are female, or levels are greater than 3.
if activity.is_active and activity.remaining > 10 and \
        user.is_active and (user.sex == 'female' or user.level > 3):
    user.add_coins(10000)
    return
```

```python
if activity.allow_new_user() and user.match_activity_condition():
    user.add_coins(10000)
    return
```

# Pay attention to the duplicate code under different branches
The duplicate code is the enemy of code quality, and conditional statements are very easy to become the hardest hit areas for duplicate code. Therefore, we need to pay attention not to produce unnecessary duplicate code when writing conditional branch statements

Let's look at the following example:
```python
# Create new user profiles for new users, otherwise update the old data.
if user.no_profile_exists:
    create_user_profile(
        username=user.username,
        email=user.email,
        age=user.age,
        address=user.address,
        # For new users, set the users' points to 0.
        points=0,
        created=now(),
    )
else:
    update_user_profile(
        username=user.username,
        email=user.email,
        age=user.age,
        address=user.address,
        updated=now(),
    )
```

```python
if user.no_profile_exists:
    extra_args = {'points': 0, 'created': now()}
else:
    extra_args = {'updated': now()}

update_user_profile(
    username=user.username,
    email=user.email,
    age=user.age,
    address=user.address,
    **extra_args
)
```

# Use ternary expressions with caution

Remember that ternary expressions only can be used to handle simple logical branches.

```python
language = "python" if you.favor("dynamic") else "golang"
```

Use the common `if/else` statements for the most cases.

# Common Tips

### Bad

```python
# Refuse to provide the service if the user is not logged in or the user is not using chrome.
if not user.has_logged_in or not user.is_from_chrome:
    return "our service is only available for chrome logged in user"
```

### Good

Thus De Morgan's Law comes. In layman's terms, De Morgan's law is making not A or not B equivalent to not (A and B).
So you can rewrite the above code like this:

```python
if not (user.has_logged_in and user.is_from_chrome):
    return "our service is only open for chrome logged in user"
```

# Boolean values of custom objects

```python
>>> bool([])
False

>>> bool([1])
True

>>> bool('')
False

>>> bool('s')
True
```

#  Use `all()` / `any()` in conditional statements

The two functions all() and any() are very suitable for conditional statements. Each of the two functions accepts an iterable object and returns a Boolean value:

* all(seq): Return True only if all objects in seq are True, otherwise return False
* any(seq): Return True as long as any object in seq is True, otherwise return False

Let's say we have the following code:

```python
def all_numbers_gt_10(numbers):
    """Return True only if all numbers in the sequence are greater than 10.
    """
    if not numbers:
        return False

    for n in numbers:
        if n <= 10:
            return False
    return True
```

If you use the built-in function all() with a simple generator expression, the above code can be written like this:

```python
def all_numbers_gt_10_2(numbers):
    return bool(numbers) and all(n > 10 for n in numbers)
```

# The precedence for and  or

Take a look at the two expressions below, and guess their values are the same?

```python
>>> (True or False) and False
False

>>> True or False and False
True
```
