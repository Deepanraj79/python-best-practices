# Logging

Logging- We can track events in a software application.

## Serves two purposes:

* Diagnostic logging records events related to the application’s operation. If a user calls in to report an error,
    for example, the logs can be searched for context. 
* Audit logging records events for business analysis. A user’s transactions can be extracted and combined with
    other user details for reports or to optimise a business goal.

`Print` - The only time when print() is a better option than logging is when the goal is to display a help statement for a 
command line application.
